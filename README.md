# Chicago-Crime-Analysis
This article discusses the Chicago Crime dataset and how it can be used to uncover crime patterns in Chicago to help the Chicago Police Department 
(PD) improve public safety in the city. The data file contains 20 years of criminal history, including crime type and information about the crime's location.
The author performs data cleaning, creates new columns, and analyzes the data to identify the types of crimes that the PD should prioritize and where 
they are most likely to occur. The article reveals that theft and battery are prevalent crimes in the city, occurring mostly on the streets, in residential areas,
and in public places, and the analysis shows the times and days of the week when these crimes are most likely to occur.
The author hopes that these insights will provide the Chicago PD with actionable information to help them combat crime and improve public safety in the city.
